1. Lying on Your Resume

Tell the truth from the start, because you will be held responsible for the information you provide -- and your employer will check it.

If you are in the market for a new job, don't send your resume from your office computer, which most likely is monitored by IT. Assume your instant messages and emails are fair game as well.

3. <b><i>Gossiping</b></i>

Walls have ears. Keep gossip to yourself. Winding up on the wrong side of the rumor mill can cost you more than somebody's trust; it can mean your job.

Spending much of your work time <b><i>orchestrating</b></i> your own personal business usually results in being given an opportunity to spend all of your time on the phone on personal business -- looking for a new job, Star warns.

5. Drinking at Work

One of the quickest ways to be shown the door is drinking too much at lunch and walking into a wall. Maintaining your own <b><i>clarity</b></i> is extremely important.

Spending much of your workday <b><i>cruising</b></i> around cyberspace puts you just a point-and-click away from unemployment. And checking <b><i>adult-oriented</b></i> Web sites on the job is a definite no-no.

7. Becoming Romantically Involved with the Boss

While it may make for great water-cooler discussion, a boss/direct-report <b><i>romance</b></i> can easily end with someone out of a job. (Hint: It's usually not the boss.)

8. Forgetting to Double-Check Your Figures

When working with numbers, scrutinize your work carefully. One <b><i>stray</b><i> zero could make the difference between being employed and unemployed, advises Star.

9. Alienating Your Coworkers

To do your job <b><i>effectively</b></i>, you'll need the <b><i>cooperation</b></i>, support and good will of those around you. Becoming <b><i>detached</b></i> from those you work with could get you replaced with someone who can work well with others.

10. Pointing the Finger at Everyone but Yourself

Take ownership of your job. If you make a mistake, own up to it. Don't try to sweep your mistakes under the carpet -- or worse yet, blame somebody else -- because the truth will usually come back to bite you on the bottom line. And nobody wants to trust or employ a liar, says Star.
