Not only does billionaire Donald Trump not 'regret' questioning President Barack Obama's birth place, Trump now says there's 'a very good chance' president Obama pretended to be Kenyan in order to attract financial aid money in college.

'The Donald' got on the subject of Obama's background today after he was asked during the Q and A portion of a National Press Club luncheon if he regretted his past statements about the president's birthplace. 'Not even a little bit, ' Trump said. 'I don't regret it.'

Though many Americans have tired of Trump's quest to see Obama's personal records, Trump claims people on the street are still asking him to pursue the issue.

Several days before the 2012 presidential election, Trump announced that he was offering President Obama $5 million to put toward a charity in his home town, Chicago, Illinois, if he turned over his birth certificate, passport and college records.

Unlike Obama, Trump says he's all facts and no fiction. His hair? Totally real, Trump said on Tuesday. 'They attack my hair. It's mine, ' Trump said during his speech while yanking on his head. 'Would anybody like to inspect?'

'They say you wear the worst hairpiece I've ever seen, what a horrible wig, ' he continued, explaining that he's made it clear on Twitter that his hair is real, yet people keep claiming it's fake for some reason he said.

'You know it's funny, but when people wanna keep going, they keep going, ' Trump noted.

'We're going to see what happens in '16, ' he said. 'If I don't see the right person, I will do something in '16.'
